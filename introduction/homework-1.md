# Decentralised Systems

In order to have a decentralised game like Monopoly we must not have a central instance managing all assets.  
Every turn in gameplay needs to be approved by validators which beforehand aggreed on a consensus mechanism on how to approve certain steps.  
This should solve prolbmes like cheating, state of the system, communications problems f.e. timeouts, how to decide who should take the next turn and how to allow the correct people to join the game.
